This is an unexploitable bug where the user can control the size of the section being passed as 0, causing malloc(0) to request a block of memory and then print out the first three before it's used elsewhere. This could be considered as memory-sensitive information leakage and there is no memory corruption. I don't quite understand why CVE assigned a code execution for this. It seems to be too harmless...
