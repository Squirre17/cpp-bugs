This bug is a null-terminate issue when converting from char* in C to std::string. If you want this bug convert to exploitable vuln, you need a function that use concatenated string's size to rewrite the original C data structure. It seems difficult to find this kind of function, so this can be considered a memory-sensitive information leak, so it is not very harmful.
