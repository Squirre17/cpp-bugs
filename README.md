# INTRODUCTION
I gather a series of CPP bugs I have encountered in practice or project audits for the purpose of security research.
Most of them cannot be exploited in real world, or difficult to exploit with my current level of expertise. Even though, I would like to create a minimal program to demonstrate these bugs and provide PoC.

All details can be found in `README.md` in each subdirectory.
