# INTRODUCTION
I gather a series of CPP bugs I have encountered in practice or project audits for the purpose of security research.
Most of these bugs cannot be exploited, or are difficult to exploit with my current level of expertise. Therefore, I would like to create a minimal program to demonstrate these bugs and provide PoC.

All detail can be found in README.md of subdirectory.
